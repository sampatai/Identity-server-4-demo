## Overview

OAuth2 and OpenID Connect are protocols that enable the development of more secure applications.

### OAuth2

- **Definition**: OAuth2 is the industry-standard protocol for authorization, allowing third-party applications to access user accounts by delegating user authentication to the service hosting the account.
- **Process**:
  1. The user provides credentials to the authorization server.
  2. The server responds with a token.
  3. The user uses this token to communicate with the API and retrieve data.
  4. The API validates the token to check user access to the requested endpoint.

### OpenID Connect

- **Definition**: OpenID Connect builds on OAuth2 by providing an authentication layer, enabling clients to verify user identity after authentication on the authorization server.

## Refresh Tokens

### Purpose

- **What are Refresh Tokens?**: Credentials used to acquire new access tokens when they expire, typically having a longer lifespan than access tokens.
- **Flow**:
  1. The application securely stores the refresh token.
  2. When the access token expires, the application uses the refresh token to request a new access token.
  3. If the refresh token is revoked, the user must re-authenticate.

## JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

### Definition

- **What is JWT?**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are a standard for user authentication and authorization in systems that communicate with each other.

### JWT Example Scenario

1. User sends a login request with credentials.
2. The Authentication Server validates the credentials and generates a token using a secret key.
3. The server returns the token to the user, which is stored in the userâ€™s Token column in the database.
4. The user includes the JWT in the header of API calls, and the server verifies its validity.

### JWT Structure

JWT consists of three main parts encoded with Base64:

1. **Header**: Contains token type and signing algorithm.
2. **Payload**: Holds claims, providing unique data between the client and server.
3. **Signature**: Ensures data integrity by combining the header, payload, and secret key.

## OAuth2 Overview

- **Definition**: OAuth2 is an open authorization protocol for data communication between applications. It enables secure access to data resources.
- **Endpoints**:
  - **/authorize**: Obtains authorization from the resource owner.
  - **/token**: Exchanges an authorization grant for an access token.
  - **/revocation**: Enables token revocation.

## OpenID Connect Overview

- **Definition**: OpenID Connect 1.0 is a simple identity layer on top of OAuth2, allowing clients to verify user identity and obtain basic profile information.
- **Endpoints**:
  - **/userinfo**: Retrieves user profile information.
  - **/checksession**: Checks the current user's session.
  - **/endsession**: Ends the user's session.

## IdentityServer4

### Overview

- **Definition**: IdentityServer4 is a free, open-source OpenID Connect and OAuth2 framework for ASP.NET Core, centralizing authentication and access control across applications.

### Responsibilities

- Protect resources.
- Authenticate users using local accounts or external providers.
- Provide session management and single sign-on.
- Manage and authenticate clients.
- Issue identity and access tokens to clients.
- Validate tokens.

### Terminologies

#### Client Applications

- **Definition**: Applications that access secure data sources and must be registered with IdentityServer to request tokens.
- **Registration**: Involves providing necessary information such as name, redirect URI, client ID, and client secret.

#### Data Resources

- **Definition**: Specific data or information protected by IdentityServer (e.g., user profiles, sensitive documents).
- **Access Control**: Clients access resources by referencing their unique names.

## IdentityServer Functions

- **OpenID Connect Provider**: Implements OpenID Connect over OAuth2.
- **Data Protection**: Central authority for managing access to protected resources.
- **User Authentication**: Supports various authentication methods.
- **Single Sign-On**: Facilitates seamless access across applications.
- **Client Verification**: Authenticates and authorizes client applications.
- **Token Management**: Issues and verifies identity and access tokens.

### Identity and Access Tokens

#### Identity Token

- **Purpose**: Represents the result of the authentication process, containing user identifiers and authentication details.

#### Access Token

- **Purpose**: Grants access to APIs and data sources. It contains client and user information for authorization checks.

## Conclusion

Understanding OAuth2, OpenID Connect, JWT, and IdentityServer4 is crucial for developing secure applications that effectively manage user authentication and authorization across various platforms.
